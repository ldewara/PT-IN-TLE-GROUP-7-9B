<b><font face = "arial", size = "5", color = "1FF0DAE6C096"> Covid 19 affects us in many aspects of our life.  All of us suffered and experienced a lot, but let us remember that problems is part of our life, it will never leave us in our journey because without these we will not be able to reach our final destination.  Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, "We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope" Besides, aiding one another of our own helping hands could be a relief for each one of us.<br> </font>
<font face = "arial", size = "5", color = "#9E120D"> Revelation Chapter 21 verse 4 says, â€œHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things, have passed away" </font><br>
<font face = "arial", size = "5", color = "1FF0DA">   So, let us all surrender all of our worries and problems to Him because He cares  for us and He promised to be with us through our sorrows and pains.  Moreover, having faith and total reliance on our omnipotent God is a big part; He's our companion in the fight against the crisis we are facing right now.</b> <br> <br> </font>
