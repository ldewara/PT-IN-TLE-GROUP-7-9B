Butterflies have an undeniable beauty in which we, humans can see.  They do have eyes but it is proven that they cannot see clearly or they cannot see fine details in which they cannot also see their beauty.  In this pandemic, most of us see this as a nightmare, a problem, and something bad.  Most of us didn't see it's good details or outcome.  Due to this pandemic, the mother earth had time to heal and we also has time to be with our families and to know ourselves more.  Even though situations are bad, we should try to see the other side of it, the good one.  We should see it as God does in order to have hope.  Butterflies can also fly in which they can soar high, so even though something bad happened due to this pandemic, we should still continue to sear high since the world hasn't ended yet, there's still a chance. There's still hope. <b></font>
